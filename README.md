# Blockchain-Testing
Testing how bitcoin creates there hashes and connects them in a chain

Written in java, even though java isnt a suitable language for the financial industry this project is just to represent the core ideas behind the blockchain.
The code was taken from a book about blockchain.

I have added an excel spreadsheet showing the time complexity of requiring leading zeros in a hash function.
